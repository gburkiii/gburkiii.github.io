COMMUNICATION
<br><br>
Without communication nothing goes. The Pink Floyd song “Keep Talking” surges from my memories. Sitting in the back of the car with my second cousin, Nasco, after a full evening of Bulgarian drinking, dancing, and singing, he reminds me of the importance of communication. On a raw, metaphysical, human level we need communication. And we’ve lost that. So often I find myself in nature and ponder what it may be like to feel One with Her and hear Her; communicate to animals—horses who are so intuitive. Maybe one of the reasons we are so far gone as a society is that we have stopped communicating with one another and with Nature. We’ve stopped talking to our family members as often as we used to, we’ve secluded ourselves to our little space over here and we fear speaking with someone who may oppose our views.
<br><br>Communication. Recently I’ve been really thinking about what it means to allow oneself to be true 100%. No hiding, no pleasing, just making weird sounds, and letting our Soul/soils come through. Letting our Hearts Speak rather than Our Mind. Once I was laying with my grandfather’s sister, Dafinka, who is like a grandmother to me. I was overwhelmed with feelings of frustration and by laying head to head, it was as if through osmosis, telepathically, I could transfer to her all that I was feeling. And simply by conveying my Heart, my mind cleared up. 
<br><br>There are so many things we have forgotten. Things we have lost. Some unconsciously, some stripped from us and some too scary to remember. That is why my work is so rooted in ancestry because I have felt years of being disconnected and alienated from my family and land here. Music and singing helps you remember, being in the Heart is the Key. It is like an old, ancient language that no one outrightly teaches you but is transferred as you grow, again, by osmosis. But I’ve found even deeper heart communication and I feel as though I am only scratching the surface. Perhaps people across the world are rooted in the heart space, and I am sure they are, while others like me who grew up in a Westernised, compartmentalised, imperial world, separation, are taught that individuality and mind ought to be revered (the way of life). So when I come to my village here, feeling like a stranger to others and a voyager into time, I find myself pondering on this heart language and how to recuperate it. Being Good. That is one of the main things my family speaks on, and I see it in their eyes. They are good. Our great-grandmother was good and I could recount you plenty of stories of how she cared for her children and the people of the village. 
<br><br>So communication. I find it hard sometimes. Especially with people I love, perhaps fear of being too much? Or not knowing how to reveal myself and be myself and wondering if I would be loved for it. So it is better to hold back and maintain a happy face. But I know that is bullshit. So perhaps this is a bid for communication. Creating a space for me to write, and whoever comes across to tend an ear. The art of storytelling is also an art that has been partially lost and I hope our civilisation re-cradles it as central to their culture. What is central to Bulgarian folk culture? People, music, food, and goodness. At least from my point of view. 
<br><br>Mycellium. When thinking about the connections between people, mycelium comes to mind as the link between each person. Communication strengthens those, to the point where you can telepathically communicate with one another because your Soul is clear and full of Love. I don’t know why I hold back from communicating, perhaps being edited out and civilised. There are so many sounds and actions and faces and ways of being in the world that we’ve lost and do not dare to explore. This reminds me of what a Sikh practitioner told me on a pouring rainy Parisian afternoon: all the dieties and Gods that exists are the many doors that lead to the same restaurant, God. Every emotion, face, experience is a door to God. It’s like that multi-faceted deity. But we’ve barred some, forgotten others and demonised several. Now there are only certain amount of accepted expressions.
<br><br>At the end of the day, it comes from the Heart. How much Love can you Hold? How much do you Love? In a world where we’ve stopped sharing our hearts, our true selves, the remedy seems to be to express oneself truthfully and openly.
<br><br>The Pink Floyd, “Keep Talking” uses parts of Stephen Hawking’s statement: “For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.”
<br><br>
Here I will start talking, for myself and hopefully for others. As a way to get out all these thoughts and heal my lack of communication - heart, messaging, nature. Perhaps if we allowed the other to talk, and to truly hear them, we could heal the world. 
<br><br><br>
With Love,
<br>.:.
<br>Georgia
